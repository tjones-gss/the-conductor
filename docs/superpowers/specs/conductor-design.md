## v0.2 amendments (2026-05-08)

After three independent reviews of v0.1 (code-quality, architectural, devil's-advocate), the following changes landed:

1. **Schema coverage extended.** v0.1 had Zod schemas for 4 of ~12 agent return shapes; v0.2 adds the missing 8 (PlannerResult, CriticResult, ScopeJudgeResult, PremortemResult, RatifierResult, JournalistResult, ShipperResult, RetrospectiveResult) and a `SCHEMA_BY_ROLE` registry the structural validator uses to parse each template's example block.
2. **Acceptance-command binding.** Spec frontmatter now requires an `acceptance_commands:` array. The slice-scope validator runs every command; `ScopeJudgeResultSchema.superRefine` schema-rejects `ship_ready: true` when any command did not run-and-pass. Closes the silent-pass hole where green `tsc + lint + test` shipped work that missed prose acceptance criteria.
3. **Per-task iter + split tracking.** `StatusSchema` gained `task_iters: Record<task_id, number>` and `splits: Record<task_id, number>`. Resume after a mid-split crash no longer re-triggers `task-splitter` on a task that was already mid-split. Hard cap of 2 chained splits before escalation.
4. **Roster reduction 14 → 12.** `task-splitter` merged into `planner` (one role with `mode: "initial" | "split"` discriminant). `knowledge-curator` merged into `journalist` (one role, two output paths: journal entry + KB topic deltas).
5. **Phase reduction 7 → 5.** Old Phase 4 (Document) folded into Phase 4 Ship (journalist runs in parallel with shipper). Old Phase 7 (Cleanup) folded into Phase 5 Retrospective tail. The pre-v0.2 phase numbers no longer correspond.
6. **Validator script teeth.** v0.1's `validate-skill.ts` only checked file existence + frontmatter regex (would pass on empty templates). v0.2 also requires: `# Role: <name>` heading, ≥50 chars body, every template's first `\`\`\`json` block parses against its `SCHEMA_BY_ROLE` schema after `{{placeholder}}` substitution. Catches typed-out enum unions (`"a" | "b"`) and stale removed-template files.

Detailed **v0.1** sections (seven phases, fourteen roles, `task-splitter`, `knowledge-curator`) still appear later in this document under **Historical (v0.1)** headings. Implementations MUST follow **`SKILL.md` + this canonical block**, not those archived sections.

### Canonical phase flow (v0.2: phases 0–5)

| Phase | Name | Summary |
|:---:|:---|:---|
| 0 | Bootstrap | Read ADR; init `.conductor/<N>/`; Stub/Proposed → `ratifier` → user approval; paired spec exists; freeze `acceptance_commands` into `status.json`. |
| 1 | Plan | `critic`(spec) → `planner`(`initial`) → `premortem` on high-risk tasks (parallel where applicable). |
| 2 | Build | Per task: `test-writer` ∥ `worker` → `validator`. On failure: attempts log, bump `task_iters[id]`; at max iters → `planner`(`split`). If `splits[id] ≥ 2`, escalate instead of re-splitting. |
| 3 | Integration | `validator`(slice + all `acceptance_commands_required`) → `critic` → `scope-judge`. Schema blocks `ship_ready` until every acceptance command ran and passed. |
| 4 | Ship | `journalist` (journal + KB deltas) ∥ `shipper` (commit, push, PR). |
| 5 | Retrospective | `retrospective` → `skill-diff-proposal.md`; archive state; **never auto-merge** skill diffs. |

### Canonical agent roster (12 roles)

Bootstrap: `ratifier`, `spec-writer` · Plan: `critic`, `planner`, `premortem` · Build: `worker`, `test-writer`, `validator`, `planner` (split mode) · Integration: `validator`, `critic`, `scope-judge` · Ship: `journalist`, `shipper` · Meta: `retrospective`.

**v0.1 → v0.2 merges:** `task-splitter` → `planner` with `mode: "split"`; `knowledge-curator` → second output path of `journalist` (KB topic deltas).

## 1. Goal

Build a Claude Code skill — `conductor` — that turns Claude into a **pure orchestrator** for ADR-driven implementation work in this repo. Claude does no implementation work itself: every task is dispatched to a subagent. The orchestrator's only jobs are decomposing work, dispatching, routing results between agents, escalating to the user when policy requires it, and persisting state so runs can pause and resume.

The motivation is **lifespan-per-session**: by paying only for prompt-out and summary-back (not the full work product), one 250k-token session can drive **10–15 ADRs end-to-end** instead of 2–3.

## 2. Core principle: Pragmatic Purist

Claude (the orchestrator) **does not call** Read/Edit/Write/Bash/Grep on implementation files: source, tests, migrations, configs, or any project artifact larger than a control surface.

Claude **may directly read** a small, named control surface:

- The ADR being driven (`docs/adr/NNNN-*.md`)
- The paired implementation spec (`docs/specs/NNNN-*.md`)
- The journal template (`docs/journal/README.md`)
- The route-map and top-level spec (`docs/route-map.md`, `docs/spec.md`) when topology matters
- The on-disk orchestrator state (`.conductor/<N>/status.json`, `events.jsonl`)
- Structured agent return values

Everything else flows through agents.

## 3. Scope: paired-spec model

ADRs in this repo are decision records — Context/Decision/Consequences/Alternatives, ≤1 page each. They are **not** implementation specs.

The orchestrator consumes a **paired implementation spec** at `docs/specs/NNNN-<adr-slug>-implementation.md`. If one does not exist, Phase 0 dispatches a `spec-writer` agent to draft one from the ADR. The spec contains:

- Acceptance criteria (testable statements)
- Task decomposition hints
- Touched-files inventory
- Risk flags (auto-derived from linked ADRs)

ADRs remain immutable once Accepted. Specs iterate freely.

## 4. Architecture

### Historical (v0.1): agent roster and lifecycle

> **Archive only.** The table below describes the **pre-v0.2** fourteen-role model. Do not add `task-splitter` or `knowledge-curator` templates to new installs; they were merged in v0.2 (see canonical block at top).

### 4.1 Agent roster (v0.1)

| Tier | Role | Lifecycle | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Core** | `worker` | one task | diff path + status |
| | `test-writer` | one task | test paths + coverage notes |
| | `validator` | one run | `{pass: bool, failed_step, first_error_loc, summary_path}` |
| | `journalist` | one shift | journal-entry path |
| | `knowledge-curator` | one shift | KB-delta path |
| **Supporting** | `spec-writer` | one spec | spec path |
| | `planner` | one spec | `plan.json` + TaskCreate calls |
| | `task-splitter` | one stuck task | replacement subtasks for `plan.json` |
| | `ratifier` | one Stub ADR | proposal path + open_questions_count |
| | `shipper` | one PR | branch/PR URL |
| **Critic-tier** | `critic` | post-spec & post-impl | `{verdict, concerns[]}` |
| | `scope-judge` | end of slice | `{ship_ready: bool, missing[]}` |
| **Risk-tier** | `premortem` | high-risk task | `{risks[], mitigations[]}` |
| **Meta-tier** | `retrospective` | end of run | proposed skill diff path |

### 4.2 High-risk auto-flag

Tasks linked to these ADRs auto-trigger `premortem`:

- **0003** Authorization model — RLS
- **0004** Money handling — integer cents
- **0005** Idempotency / exactly-once
- **0006** Audit log — append-only
- **0009** Member identity & ID verification
- **0023** Privacy / GDPR / data deletion

Additional ADRs may be flagged in the paired spec via `risk: high` frontmatter.

## 5. Phase flow

### Historical (v0.1): seven-phase diagram

> **Archive only.** Phase numbers **do not** match v0.2 (0–5). See the canonical table in the v0.2 amendments section above.

```
/conductor <N>
    ↓
Phase 0  Bootstrap         read ADR; init .conductor/<N>/; if Status: Stub or Proposed → ratifier → user approves → write back to docs/adr/; ensure spec exists
Phase 1  Plan              critic(spec) → planner → premortem(high-risk, parallel)
Phase 2  Build             per task: test-writer ║ worker → validator
                           on fail: append attempt, re-spawn worker w/ history
                           max 5 iters → auto-decompose task → retry
                           only escalate if decomposition also fails
Phase 3  Integration       validator(full) → critic(diff vs spec) → scope-judge
Phase 4  Document          journalist ║ knowledge-curator
Phase 5  Ship              shipper: commit + push + PR
Phase 6  Retrospective     proposes skill diff, queues for user review (NEVER auto-merges)
Phase 7  Cleanup           archive .conductor/<N>/
```

Every phase transition is an atomic write to `.conductor/<N>/status.json`. `/conductor resume` reads `status.json` and re-enters at the recorded phase.

## 6. Loop semantics

**v0.2 note:** In production behavior, “spawn **task-splitter**” below is **`planner` with `mode: split`**, with per-task `splits[id]` tracking and the two-split cap before escalation (see `SKILL.md`).

### 6.1 Validator loop (Phase 2 per-task)

```
worker(task, attempt_log) → diff
validator(task, diff) → {pass, failure}
  if pass:                  task complete, advance
  if fail and iters < 5:    append failure to attempts/<task>.md, re-spawn worker
  if fail and iters == 5:   spawn task-splitter to decompose into smaller subtasks,
                            replace original task in plan.json, restart loop
  if decomposition fails:   escalate to user (Telegram + chat)
```

### 6.2 Critic loop (Phase 1 spec critique, Phase 3 diff critique)

```
critic(input) → {verdict: ship|revise, concerns[]}
  if ship:                  advance
  if revise and iters < 3:  re-spawn the producer (spec-writer or worker) w/ concerns
  if revise and iters == 3: escalate
```

A Phase 3 critic `revise` verdict re-opens the affected tasks back into the Phase 2 worker loop with the concerns list as additional context. Tasks that were not flagged stay complete.

### 6.3 Scope-judge (Phase 3 terminal)

```
scope-judge(spec, all_diffs, all_validator_reports) → {ship_ready: bool, missing[]}
  if ship_ready:    advance to Ship (v0.2 Phase 4)
  if not:           re-enter Phase 2 with `missing[]` as new tasks
```

## 7. State on disk

```
.conductor/                       # gitignored
  <adr-number>/
    status.json                   # {phase, current_task_id, iter_count, started_at, ...}
    spec.md                       # symlink or copy of docs/specs/<n>-*.md
    plan.json                     # task graph (also reflected in TaskCreate state)
    events.jsonl                  # append-only event log
    attempts/
      <task-id>.md                # per-task failure trail
    dispatches/
      0001-spec-writer.md         # full prompt-out + summary-back per dispatch
      0002-planner.md
      ...
    journal-draft.md              # WIP, promoted to docs/journal/ at Phase 5
    kb-deltas.md                  # WIP, promoted to KB at Phase 5
    skill-diff-proposal.md        # retrospective output, awaits user review
  _archive/                       # completed runs
    <adr-number>/...
```

`.conductor/` is **gitignored**. The journal entry and KB additions are *promoted* into the repo by the shipper at Phase 5; the orchestrator's working memory is not committed.

## 8. Token-efficiency techniques (orchestrator-side)

These are mandatory for the orchestrator's prompts and result handling:

1. **Agents return decision-grade structured output.** Validators return `{pass, failed_step, first_error_loc, summary_path}` not prose. Workers return `{status, diff_path, files_touched, summary_path}`. Full work product written to disk; orchestrator reads only the decision data.
2. **Pass paths, not content.** Dispatch prompts give agents file paths to read for themselves. The orchestrator never embeds spec text in a prompt.
3. **Disk as memory.** After each phase transition, working set drops to the next-action pointer. State is rehydrated from `status.json` after auto-compression.
4. **Append-only event log with offset tracking.** `events.jsonl` is read by delta, not in full.
5. **Background dispatch + batched checkpoints.** Independent agents run via `run_in_background=true`; completions are read in batches.
6. **SKILL.md is minimal.** Templates and prompt fragments live in `.claude/skills/conductor/templates/` and are loaded by agents, not the orchestrator.
7. **KB keyed by topic.** Workers read the slice relevant to their task only.
8. **No echo.** Orchestrator does not paraphrase agent output back to the user; it surfaces only decision points and escalations.
9. **No status polling.** TaskList/file rereads are avoided in favor of `status.json` reads at phase boundaries.
10. **ScheduleWakeup over wait-loops** for long agent runs.

## 9. Self-improvement loops

Three independent loops reinforce each other:

1. **Per-iteration learning** — every validator failure appends a one-liner to `attempts/<task>.md`. The next worker dispatch reads this. Prevents repeating the same failed approach.
2. **Per-shift KB feedback** — **`journalist`** writes topic-keyed KB deltas under `docs/kb/` during Ship (same pass as the journal entry; v0.2 absorbed `knowledge-curator`). Every future `worker` / `test-writer` / `spec-writer` dispatch begins by reading the KB slice for its topic. Lessons compound across shifts.
3. **Per-run skill evolution** — `retrospective` reads the entire run's dispatch log, attempt logs, and journal entry. It proposes a diff against `.claude/skills/conductor/SKILL.md` itself. The diff is written to `skill-diff-proposal.md` and surfaced to the user for explicit accept/reject. **Never auto-merged.**

## 10. Escalation policy

The orchestrator pauses and pings the user **only** for these triggers:

1. **API keys / secrets** must be configured by the user
2. **Login / OAuth / MFA / browser auth** required
3. **Money decisions** — paid tier upgrades, purchases, billing
4. **Done** — final completion notification at end of **Phase 5 (Retrospective)**. If a `skill-diff-proposal.md` was produced by the retrospective, the Done message includes the path and a one-line summary so the user can review.
5. **Ratification approval** — when `ratifier` produces a Stub→Accepted proposal at `.conductor/<N>/ratification-proposal.md`, pause and ask the user to accept (or request revisions) before any `docs/adr/` file is modified
6. **Stuck** — validator-loop max-iters exceeded **and** split lineage **`splits[id] ≥ 2`** (cannot split further); or critic-loop max-iters exceeded; or ratifier-revision loop max 3 iters
7. **Implicit guardrail (system-level)** — destructive ops on shared/production systems (force-push to main, drop tables, delete branches with unpushed work, etc.) always confirm

Notifications go to chat. If a Telegram channel is configured (`telegram:configure`), notifications also go there for trigger 4 and trigger 5 specifically (so the user can be away from the terminal).

The orchestrator does **not** ping for: design ambiguities (resolved by spec-writer + critic), validation failures within budget, premortem findings (fed into worker prompts), failed PR creation on first attempt (retried).

## 11. Invocation

```
/conductor <adr-number>          # start: drive ADR-NNNN through phases 0–5
/conductor resume                # pick up at recorded phase from status.json
/conductor status                # phase + task + acceptance_commands_run vs required + last 5 events
/conductor abort                 # mark status as aborted; no destructive cleanup
```

The slash command is implemented at `.claude/commands/conductor.md`. It dispatches the skill with arguments. Outside `/conductor`, Claude works normally — the Pragmatic Purist constraint applies *only* inside an active conductor run.

## 12. File layout

**v0.2 harness (as shipped)** — schemas live in [`scripts/conductor/schemas.ts`](../../../scripts/conductor/schemas.ts) (Zod), not standalone JSONSchema files beside the skill.

```
.claude/
  skills/
    conductor/
      SKILL.md                    # orchestrator rules (canonical)
      templates/                  # 12 Markdown role templates (*.md), not "*-prompt.md"
        critic.md
        journalist.md
        planner.md
        premortem.md

      conductor-design.md        # this file

.conductor/                      # gitignored working memory per ADR run
```

`.gitignore` adds `.conductor/` as part of skill installation.

## 13. Estimated session economics

With all techniques in §8 applied:

- One ADR end-to-end (spec → plan → 8–12 tasks built+validated → integration → docs → ship → retro): **~15–25k orchestrator tokens**
- One 250k-token session: **10–15 ADRs**, or **1–2 full slices**, before `/conductor resume` handoff is needed

Without these techniques: ~80–120k orchestrator tokens per ADR, 2–3 ADRs per session.

## 14. Out of scope

- Multi-ADR parallel orchestration in a single run (sequential only; user runs multiple `/conductor` instances if desired)
- Cross-project portability (this build is poker-club-tuned; portable v2 is future work)
- Auto-merging skill-diff proposals (always user-gated)
- Replacing existing `team:shipper`, `team:documentor`, `superpowers:requesting-code-review` agents — the conductor invokes them where they fit
- Spec-format standardization across other projects (this project's conventions only)

## 15. Open questions for the implementation plan

These are not blockers for the design but need resolution during planning:

- **Telegram trigger format** — message templates for triggers 4 and 5
- **KB topic taxonomy** — initial set of `docs/kb/` files seeded from existing ADRs
- **Spec template** — exact frontmatter and section structure for `docs/specs/NNNN-*.md`
- **Validator command set** — which commands constitute "the gauntlet" for this project (likely `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm lint`, plus spec-defined acceptance commands)
- **Skill-diff dry-run** — should the retrospective also produce a *test* of its proposed diff (e.g., simulate the run with the new skill), or is human review the only safety net? (Default: human review only, dry-run is future work.)
- **Ratifier auto-accept policy** — currently the ratifier always pauses for user approval (escalation trigger #5). Future amendment could allow auto-accept on truly low-risk ADRs (single-paragraph, no cross-refs) to reduce interruptions. Defer until interruption-frequency data is available.

## 16. Done criteria

The skill is shipped when:

- `/conductor <N>` drives ADR-0011 (time-bank model, currently Stub) end-to-end on a feature branch with a real PR
- `/conductor resume` successfully recovers from a force-quit mid-Phase 2
- The retrospective produces at least one skill-diff proposal that the user reviews
- One full slice (Slice 1: marketing + auth skeleton) is shippable via repeated `/conductor` invocations within a single 250k session

## 17. Amendments

| Date | Section(s) | Change | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-05 | §4.1, §5, §10, §15 | Added `ratifier` role; Phase 0 dispatches ratifier on Stub/Proposed status instead of refusing; new escalation trigger #5 (ratification approval). | First real `/conductor` run (against ADR-0030, Stub) refused at Phase 0. Manual ratification of all slice-1 Stubs would have been ~3-4 hours of one-off work; folding ratification into the conductor pipeline is reusable across all 24 Stubs and matches Travis's stated philosophy of agent-driven work. |
