# Acceptance commands MUST be runnable shell commands that exit 0 only when
# every numbered acceptance criterion is satisfied. The validator runs each
# one in order during the slice/integration pass; scope-judge refuses to
# return ship_ready=true if any was not run-and-passed. Bare `pnpm test`
# does NOT count — list the specific e2e/integration commands that bind
# the spec's acceptance language to runnable behavior.
